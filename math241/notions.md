### Right hand rule

In this course, we are using a right hand coordinate system them. So use your right hand. There are contentionally two ways of doing it. My favorite one starting since middle school is to use the palm, 'paper' hand shape. So the finger tips are pointing to the x direction, and the palm is facing the y and the corss product result z is where the thumb is point at. By the way, don't forget $i \times  j = k$ when you not sure about you fingers then try to rotate the xyz in your mind to verify right hand coordinate

### Triple Product

These are some special properties of scalar and vector product. For scalar triple product we have an equation like this:
$ a \cdot (b \times  c)$
The dot and cross sign can swap with each other as long as the order a,b,c is maintained because they have the same determinate form as:
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\
c_1 & c_2 & c_3
\end{vmatrix}
$$

You might remember something from linear alg. Row swap will negate the determinant. So if you wap order of A, B, C the result will have the opposite sign.

> [!NOTE]
> The geometric meaning is the volume of a parallelepiped

Then about vector triple product, it is fairly straight forward: $a\times(b\times c) = b\times(a\cdot c) - c\times(a\cdot b)$
The BAC-CAB rule. If $a$ is after $c\times b$. Solve it by $a\times b = - b\times a$
