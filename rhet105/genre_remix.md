# For International Players: A Survival Guide to Playing Pool in China (2025)

## Intro

Playing pool in China in 2025 can feel very different from what you are used to back in the UK, the US or any other part the world. Whether you are here for a short stay or living here long-term, you might find it a struggle to find an appropriate billiards hall to calm down and compete or practice. And to make it simple, driven by economics, billiards halls in China have inevitably changed over the years. We are now having all types of halls, technology-assisted setups, new atmosphere, and a completely different range of players. However, those changes may not be what you want. Fortunately, this guide will hep you understand the current situation and find the billiards hall that suits your best.

## Tips

In China, the most convenient way to filter and select billiards halls is through the app Meituan, a daily-life toolbox used for ordering food, calling taxis, finding discounts, and browsing local businesses. Of course, it also helps you locate nearby billiards halls. To help you find a better place to enjoy the sport, the following 10 tips are available.

### Better Physical Environment

#### 1. Avoid self-service halls

Self-service halls became popular because they are cheap to operate during the economic slowdown. They increase accessibility, but their low-cost model means no staff to maintain the venue. In addition, because of loose regulation, smoking is extremely common in those halls.

#### 2. Check the price range — not too low

Try to avoid pool halls with significantly low price. The reasoning would be the same as above and a recommend range of price should be around 20-35 yuan per hour.

#### 3. Smaller halls are usually better

Small halls often exist because the owner personally enjoys the sport or wants to contribute to the community. These owners usually care more about table quality and overall cleanliness. They don't aim for the money, so smaller halls tend to be quieter, cleaner, and better maintained.

#### 4. Check photos: warm light, no RGB or LED strips

RGB lights and LED strips look good in online ads but are distracting and unhelpful for actual play.  Warm, simple overhead lighting is a better sign that the owner understands the sport and cares about actual players.

#### 5. Avoid 24-hour halls

Although 24-hour availability sounds appealing, it means the tables run continuously with little time for maintenance. As a result, table condition there are usually worse. It is very common to find holes on the cloth especially in breaking zone.

## Better Culture Environment

#### 6. But also avoid halls that are too expensive

Expensive halls often position themselves as entertainment venues. They may offer alcohol, lounge seating, and additional services that make the space more social and less suitable for focused practice. If you aim for simple place to practice, that is not the place to go.

#### 7. Look for halls with American or Snooker tables

Chinese pool dominates in China today. If a hall still maintains American tables or snooker tables, it usually means the owner understands cue-sports culture more deeply and is not just following mainstream trends. These halls tend to attract more disciplined players and preserve a more traditional atmosphere.

#### 8. Avoid halls with “assistant players”

“Assistant players” may sound helpful, but most are hired entertain social groups. Many are not skilled players, and their role focuses more on emotional support or social interaction. In some cases, they may involve explicit services which is apparently illegal.

#### 9. Check how many years the hall has been open

Many new halls appear simply because the sport became profitable in recent years. These places often prioritize business rather than sporting culture. Older halls survived through the years when cue sport was not popular, making them more reliable if you want a respectful, focused environment.

#### 10. Go early in the morning

Morning hours attract players who treat the sport seriously or use it as part of their daily routine. Most of time, you would find few people playing there in the morning. Almost any hall -- regardless of type -- feels the best in the morning.

## Conclusion

China's pool halls may look different from what you are used to, but once you understand why they changed, it becomes much easier to find the places that match your style. The economy pushed the playing environment to change in many new directions, and not all of them are ideal. But with careful selection, we can discover halls for the real spirit of cue sports. Hopefully, this guide helps you avoid the noise and enjoy the game the way you want.
