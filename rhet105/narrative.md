# Narrative Analysis

I struggled at first to decide which genre to transform my position essay into. Although we discussed possibilities in class—such as TikTok shorts, internet memes, and infographics—I wasn’t interested in any of them. I realized that I don’t usually consume those genres, and I’m not familiar with how they work, so it didn’t feel natural for me to create something in those formats. Since I wasn’t personally connected to those genres, I felt unsure about how to start writing them. I spent some time trying to force myself to come up with a genre directly, but nothing seemed right. Eventually, I changed strategies. Instead of looking for a genre first, I tried to identify a specific audience I wanted to serve. I also wanted whatever I created to be genuinely useful. It didn’t need to be something general that applies to everyone—that would actually make my task harder. Instead, I decided to focus on a very specific group of people as my audience. That approach immediately made the process easier. Finally, I came up with the idea of giving practical tips for international players trying to find a good place to play pool in China.

My chosen audience is any international pool player who is unfamiliar with China. Even though the audience may be small, it is still valid. One obvious reason is that I’m writing in English about pool, so naturally the audience becomes foreign players (which is a bit of a joke, but not entirely wrong). The real reason comes from my position essay. In that essay, I spent more than half of the argument discussing how economic slowdown has changed billiards halls both physically and culturally. If I want to turn those ideas into something useful, a guide for finding better places to practice becomes a perfect match. It also connects directly to my own personal experience, so I have authentic insight to share. With these tips, I can explain each one using the same reasoning from my position essay. And to make the guide feel complete, I can even bring the idea of “economic forces driving accessibility” into the introduction before transitioning to the actual tips.

Once I had a general idea, I began writing. I tried to stay close to my goal of making something genuinely useful, so I literally listed the tricks I personally use when choosing a pool hall. Then I organized them into two categories: physical environment and cultural atmosphere. These two categories match the structure of my position essay, which helps maintain logical consistency when I explain my reasoning later. With this structure, the whole guide naturally falls into three parts: an introduction, the tips, and a conclusion.

Before writing, I still needed to decide on the format of the guide. Should it look like a pamphlet, an infographic, or an online thread? When I first thought about this assignment, I imagined writing it as an online article. I had a specific platform in mind: Zhihu, a Chinese community where people post well-organized long-form articles called “zhuanlan.” I wanted something like that—structured, detailed, and searchable. However, I wasn’t sure whether there was an equivalent platform internationally. Reddit has discussion threads, but they are not the same as Zhihu articles because Reddit focuses more on conversation than polished writing. Then I remembered a platform I found when searching for tutorials: Medium. Medium feels very similar to Zhihu’s article format, so I felt comfortable treating my genre remix as something that could be published there.

Even though pamphlets are a common choice for this assignment, I felt they didn’t serve my purpose. If I were in my audience’s position—an international player in China—I would definitely look for information online, not in a pamphlet. Online media spreads faster, reaches the right people, and matches how players actually search for guidance. And because my content is mostly text-based tips, an online article format is the most natural. This is also the genre I read the most and feel most familiar with, so choosing it made the project smoother and more enjoyable for me.

This section of my analysis focuses on how I approached the actual writing of the genre remix. For the introduction paragraph, I considered including the idea that economic forces have made billiards more popular in China. However, rather than giving a detailed explanation, I chose to present it only as background information. My readers are primarily players who are simply trying to find a better place to play, so they would not necessarily care about the full economic argument. If they are interested in that topic, they can search for it themselves. For the purpose of my guide, the most important and useful part is the tips, not the theory behind them.

For the tips section, I began with an introduction to the platform Meituan. Since I wanted my article to be genuinely useful, I decided to share the actual tool I personally use every time I look for a billiards hall. Introducing Meituan works as both a prerequisite and a transition into the tips that follow, giving readers a practical starting point. In the tips themselves, I included a total of ten items and numbered them. This makes it easier for my audience to skim, skip around, or revisit the parts they care about without reading everything in order. For each tip, I added a few sentences of explanation. While doing this, I embedded the reasoning from my position essay into the explanations—enough to connect the ideas, but not so much that the article becomes academic or irrelevant to players. In other words, the logic from my essay is there, but it stays in the background so the guide remains clear and practical.

Finally, because this is a complete article, I added a concluding paragraph. The conclusion does not introduce new information; instead, it helps the piece feel finished and unified. In Chinese writing, we often call this part “shenghua,” meaning to elevate or wrap up the main idea in a smooth, reflective way. The conclusion serves that purpose: it ties the tips back to the overall message while giving the article a sense of closure.
