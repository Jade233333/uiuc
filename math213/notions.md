# Notion

## proposition and proposition function

This are the notes taking during class. Because we have no lecture notes published in this class so far I will use this as a skeleton to my notions.

So starting with something I remember, we have proposistion which is basically a statement has true or false property. I my perspective, this is something mininum and fundamental. Then we learnt about propositional operations to create new propositions. Including $\cap$, $\cup$, $\neg$ and $\implies$.  After that we talked about propositional functions, which is a function taking any value and then return a true or false. For example, $P(x): \iff  x \leq  5$

Despite those, we also have quantifiers which we talked about this class. As the name suggested, they tells about how many element are we talking about. We have two specific quantifiers, *universal*, for all, $\forall$ and *existential*, there exists, $\exists$. Here is an example.

$\forall x, P(x)$

## Set

> ![Notes]
> Notation: Capital letters
> lower case a for an element
> a \epslon A
> a \not epslon A
> 
> ways to describe a set
> 1. list all(roster notation)
> 1. set builder, by common property, {x|something}
>  
> special sets:
> 1. natural number N
> 1. intergers Z
> 1. fractions Q
> 1. real numbers R

Then we moved on to another topic, about sets provide a range of an element. To complete the class note we have the following notations where a is or is not an element of A. Uppercase of sets and lower case for elements.
$a \in  A$
$a \notin  A$

So we have two differnt way to specify a set. Listing all the elements or describe there command feature. Here is an comparison.

$\{x \in  \mathbb{Z} | x is even\}$
$\{..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...\}$

Also here are the list of common sets.

| Sets   | Symbol    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Real Number   | $\mathbb{R}$   |
| Fractions   | $\mathbb{Q}$   |
| Natural Number   | $\mathbb{N}$   |
| Integers   | $\mathbb{Z}$   |
